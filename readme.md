# Brainfuck to assembly compiler and interpreter.
This is a compiler for brainfuck. It compiles to assembly and can interpret brainfuck.

# How to use it?
There is a help command. But to get you started you can use the command `dotnet run comp main.bf main.o` to get a working linux executable that will print hello world.
`int` is the alternative and will not create an exe but will interpret the brainfuck.
